# Geant4 Simulation of Plastic Scintillator BC408 for HEP Muography Group at UIUC and Occidental College

We simulate the passage of a 100 GeV positive muon through a volume of BC408 and collect scintillation photon hits with four sensitive detectors, to be read out into ROOT histograms and csv files for analysis. Scintillation light yield has been validated against the expected theoretical quantity predicted by Bethe-Bloch and Birks' Law.

## Installation

Must have Geant4 source code installed. 
1. Clone the repository locally into same root directory as Geant4 source code
2. Create a build directory and navigate to it. Run cmake ..
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
3. Run make from build directory
```
make
```
3. Run Executable: ./sim_bc408_1
```
./sim_bc408_1
```
4. After running events, hits will be stored in output.root file in build directory as well as in output_events_hist.csv. To access root files, run root output.root and open a new TBrowser.
```
root output.root
new TBrowser
```
